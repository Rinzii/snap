Fuzzing harnesses for snap live in this directory.

Build with libFuzzer support enabled:
  cmake -S .. -B ../out/fuzz -DSNAP_BUILD_FUZZERS=ON
  cmake --build ../out/fuzz --target snap_byteswap_fuzzer

A short smoke run is wired into CTest and can be executed with:
  ctest --test-dir ../out/fuzz -R snap_byteswap_fuzzer_smoke --output-on-failure

Each harness links with the snap interface library and uses -fsanitize=fuzzer by
default (falling back to the compiler's native support if address/undefined
sanitizers are unavailable).
